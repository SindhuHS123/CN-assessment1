A06:

This is to calculate UDP checksum , we have taken three 16 bit numbers,using binary addition add these three numbers and we get the result in 16 bit.
Convert that to 1's complement we need to data to the 3numbers along eith the checksum to reciever.
The reciever will get the data as well as the checksum what we calculated, and the reciever adds the data what we have provided along with checksum91's complement result0
are added together.

If the output of sum of 16bit data and checksum is 1111111111111111.All fields will be in binary 1,even if there is one zero error is introduced in the data during transaction
of data from sender to reciever.
